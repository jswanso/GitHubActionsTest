# GitHub Actions Test

This is a playground for me to test out GitHub actions. See official [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) documentation for concepts.

As instructed in the GitHub's [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#the-components-of-github-actions) workflows section, my workflows can be found in the [workflows](.github/workflows) folder of this project.
